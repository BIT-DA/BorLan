Official implementation of our ICCV 2023 paper (BorLan). 

## Paradigm Introduction

BorLan is a simple data-efficient learning paradigm that includes three parts:

1. Obtain text embedding of task concepts via pre-trained language model (PLM). (This part can be conducted before the visual training once and for all for a given dataset.)
2. Main task loss (i.e., CrossEntropy)
3. Distribution alignment loss that leverages text embedding space to promote data-efficient visual training.

## Training 

### Step 1: Obtain text embedding of concepts via PLM.

Run the following command to obtain text embeddings.

You need to modify the following things in the code:

- classnames: List
- save_name: str 

```python
# Bert-Large
python text_features/text_embedding.py

# GPT-2
python text_features/text_embedding_gpt.py

# CLIP ViT-Large
python text_features/text_embedding_clip.py
```

### Step 2: Linguistic knowledge guided vision model training.

Run the following command for Semi-Supervised Learning tasks:

```python
sh run.sh
```
